# AppReviewKit

During the past years I realized that "traditional" prompts for rating apps do no longer work. App users are used to these prompts and close them immediately.

Thus, I developed an alternative solution to prompt your users to review or rate your app on the App Store. 

Live Demo: soon

This project is a part of my soon to be released online courses on http://appstoreboosting.teachable.com/courses/app-store-reviews. The course will be for free. You can already enroll, please not though that I am still working on the content. If you enroll the course, you will be notified via email as soon as it is ready.

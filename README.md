# AppReviewKit

During the past years I realized that "traditional" prompts for rating apps do no longer work. App users are used to these prompts and close them immediately.

Thus, I developed an alternative solution to prompt your users to review or rate your app on the App Store. It does the following:
- display an app rating view (5 outlined stars) above the app's settings
- once the user taps one of the stars, the stars will be replaced by filled ones and a UIAlert prompt is displayed
- if the user chooses 3-5 stars, the user will be asked to review, otherwise the user will be asked for feedback via email
- the next time the app's settings are loaded, the rating view will no longer be displayed

I believe this solution is better than generic UIAlert prompts because they do not interrupt the user's experience, instead the user him/herself decides to rate the app (pull instead of push).
